        <!-- Assignment
Use the BMI example from Activity #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI.The message can be 
either "Lucas' BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Lucas'!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs.Example: 
"Lucas' BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
HINT: Use an if/else statement -->
