                <p class="otherwordly"> THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA Borealis, or northern light, begin high in the Earth's atmosphere-
                    at altitdues from 60 to more than 250 miles- when charged particles from the sun become trapped in
                    the Earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show.
                    <br>
                    The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Anttarctica. Luckily there are more accessible
                    places if you'd like to take in these lights shows yourself . For the best seats to this celestial scene, consider anywhere with
                    a magnetic latitude above 55C and how low light pollution. Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.
                    <br>
                    In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night.
